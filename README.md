# BA780_7b-Project
## Predicting Heart Disease and Heart Failure
_A repository for our BA780 project on Heart disease/heart failure data._

In this project we set out to create two logistic regression ML models to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient and to predict the probability of fatal heart failure respectively. We base our analysis on two datasets, to which we link below:

We did our work in Python, using primarily Pandas package for the data management, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization and Scikit Learn for the machine learning portion of the project.
